The first type, and the one you are most familiar with, is called positional, because it is associated with a parameter by the position it occupies in the argument list (which generally corresponds to the position of the parameter in the function signature). The second type is called a keyword argument. Keyword arguments are preceded by a name and an equals sign, and they are associated with parameters by name (so they don't have to appear in any particular order)."

The field name begins with either a number, which specifies a positional argument to the `format()` method, or a name, which specifies a named argument. This can be followed by extra information that allows you to index the selected argument (which will presumably be an indexable object such as a list, tuple, or dict) or access one of its attributes."

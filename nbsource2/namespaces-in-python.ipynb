When you call a function or method, Python dynamically creates a new namespace and binds the argument values to the parameter names in that namespace. Assignments made during execution of the function call (normally) result in bindings in the function call  or ___local___) namespace. When the function returns, the namespace is automatically destroyed, and any bindings inside the namespace are lost. If any objects are no longer referenced as a result of this, the memory used to store those values becomes reclaimable as garbage."
